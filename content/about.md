# Things I like

- giving classes and talks
- learning new skills
- [riding my motorcycle](https://geonnave.com/posts/em-frente-enfrente-a-trovoada/)
- making puns and [writing pariodies](https://geonnave.com/posts/browsemian-rhapsody/)
- all sorts of physical activities: hiking, trekking, crossfit training, biking, lifting weights, martial arts, crossfit
- and other random stuff such as theater, improv, surfing



# Projects

- [CodeIoT](http://codeiot.org.br): In 2017, I've helped to build CodeIoT, a free platform with courses teaching about the Internet of Things. So far it has had more than 250,000 students.
- [Caninos Loucos](https://caninosloucos.org/en/program-en/): a program to develop open Single Board Computers (SBCs) to enable IoT innovation in Brazil and beyond.
- [IoT Swarms](https://swarm-os.netlify.app/): a research group at Universidade de São Paulo, we research and develop technologies to enable creation of Swarms of IoT devices.
- [BNDES IoT Cities](https://cidadesiot.lsitec.org.br/): Experiments of Internet of Things solutions in public safety and urban mobility, in the city of São Paulo.
