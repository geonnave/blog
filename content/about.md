Computer Scientist working towards a PhD in Electrical Engineering at the University of SÃ£o Paulo.
Currently working as a Visiting Researcher at UC Berkeley.

My research topic is Access Control in decentralized and open IoT environments.
In particular, I am trying to create a system that allows secure spontaneous interactions among cross-domain devices in the Internet of Things.

I enjoy giving classes and talks, making puns, and [riding a motorcycle whenever I can](https://geonnave.com/posts/em-frente-enfrente-a-trovoada/).

# Some choices that made my life better:

* Practicing Kung Fu - my body is healthier, so is my mind.
* Theater classes - crucial for balancing (social) life with a totally different activity than my technical work.

# The project I'm most proud of:

In 2017, I've helped to build [CodeIoT](http://codeiot.org.br), a free platform with courses teaching about the Internet of Things. So far it has had more than 50,000 students.
