Computer Scientist working towards a PhD in Electrical Engineering at the University of SÃ£o Paulo. My research is about Swarm Computing, in particular I am trying to figure out how to create an open but controlled access control environemnt for resource sharing among autonomous computational agents.

I also like giving classes and talks, making puns, and [riding a motorcycle whenever I can](https://geonnave.com/posts/em-frente-enfrente-a-trovoada/).

# Some choices that made my life better:

* Practicing Kung Fu - my body is healthier, so is my mind.
* Theater classes - crucial for balancing (social) life with a totally different activity than my technical work.

# The project I'm most proud of:

* In 2017, I've helped to build [CodeIoT](http://codeiot.org.br), a free platform with courses teaching about the Internet of Things (my research topic).
