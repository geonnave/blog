# Title: Browsemian Rhapsody

## Author: Webie Mercury

```
is this web design?
is this a stylesheet?
caught in a web browser
no escape from javascript

open emacs
look up to the chars and see
it's just a null var, it has no value of it
because it's easy run, easy burn
error high, so slow
any way the RAM blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

mama, just killed the DOM
put content in the <head>
wrote a script, outside the tag
mama, the web has just begun
but now I've gone and coded it all wrong

mama, ooh
didn't mean to make it crash
if I don't fix this memory leak tomorrow
carry on, carry on, the app doesn't really matters...

too late, deadline has come
sends shivers down my spine
fingers aching all the time
goodbye, everybody, I will deploy
gotta leave it all behind and git push

mama, ohh
I don't wanna be fired
I sometimes wish I'd never programmed at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
scaramouche, scaramouche, are you the Architecto?
framework, javascript
very very frightening me
(Meteor) Meteor
(Angular) Angular
Vue.js Figaro
spaghetti code -o-o-o-o.

I'm just a poor dev, nobody pairs me
he's just a poor dev from a poor company
spare his app from this monstrosity

Error high, so slow, will you let me code!
Vanilla! no, we will not let you code (let him code!)
Vanilla! we will not let you code (let him code!)
Vanilla! we will not let you code (let him code!)
will not let you code (let him code!)
never let you code (never, never, never, never let me code!)
oh oh oh oh
no no no no no no no
oh, mama mia, mama mia, (mama mia let me code)
Beelzebub has a framework put aside for me, for me, for me

so you think I can't code something from scratch?
so you think you can shove me the lib of the day?
oh baby, can't do this to me, baby
just gotta log out, just gotta log right outta here

(ohhh, ohh yeah, ohh yeah)

nothing really matters
anyone can see
nothing really matters
nothing really matters to me

anyway the RAM blows...
